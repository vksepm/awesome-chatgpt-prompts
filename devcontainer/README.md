# Jekyll Project Codespace Configuration

This README provides information about the Codespace configuration for the Jekyll project.

## Overview

This configuration sets up a development environment for a Jekyll project using Docker. It includes necessary dependencies and tools to facilitate development.

## Getting Started

1. **Open the Codespace**: Once the Codespace is created, it will automatically build the Docker image defined in the `Dockerfile`.
2. **Install Extensions**: The specified extensions in `devcontainer.json` will be installed automatically.
3. **Post-Create Commands**: Any commands specified in `devcontainer.json` will run after the environment is set up.
